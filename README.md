# LLM App

A simple Streamlit application that utilizes OpenAI's language model to generate responses based on user input. This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's API with a Streamlit app to create an interactive, AI-powered response generator.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Users can input text and receive responses generated by the OpenAI language model.
- **API Key Integration:** Securely uses the OpenAI API key to access the language model.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Provides warnings if the API key is not properly configured.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd llm-app
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Add Your OpenAI API Key:**
   Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```toml
   [openai]
   openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
   ```

6. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Open the application in your browser. 
- Enter your text into the text area and click 'Submit'.
- The app will display a response generated by the OpenAI language model.
